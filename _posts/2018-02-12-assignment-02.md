"**DUE: Sunday 2/11 @11:59pm.**

*Propose and analyze a problem that forms the basis of a design project for this class.*

In one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation. This description should convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a semester considering. State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will enhance an existing application or practice.

In another paragraph, analyze the problem or idea to give more background and context. Do not just focus on the negative aspects of the current situation, but also identify some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain. A few salient examples from existing systems or practices could be used to support those claims. If appropriate, you may conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that illustrates how someone might encounter and resolve the problem.

Ensure your report is appropriately clear and easy to read. This includes:
- text should be clear and concise
- use section headings as appropriate
- include images in the body of the write-up with appropriate  figure numbers and captions (and citations!!!!)
- refer to the figures in the body of your text
- check for typos, spelling, and grammar errors

Be sure your presentation looks good:
- choose appropriate colors, fonts, and styles
- make liberal use of whitespace

*Be prepared to pitch your project idea to the class.*

**Submission**
No more than one page of text (approximately 500 words).

Images do not count against your page limit, and are therefore effectively free. You should embed images throughout your proposal, keeping them near the text that references them. The limit applies to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed.

Create a new page on your Github User page to host your individual project proposal. Post the link (with the project title) to the appropriate Slack channel.

**Grading**
This proposal will be graded on a scale of 5 points:
- Problem and Motivation: (2 points)
- Analysis of Problem: (1 points)
- Novelty and Creativity: (1 points)
- Report Clarity and Presentation: (1 points)"
